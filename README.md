# DateTimeProject

A project for a university test on using Python classes.
There are two classes here: a class for storing Date/Time and a container class for the previous one.

Class Date/Time:
-Two constructors: from a dictionary or from a string (by mask);
-Change data via Getter/Setter;
-Save and load to/from JSON.

Container class:
-Constructor creates an empty array;
-Methods for adding/removing an element with input type checking;
-Save and load to/from JSON.

In addition menu, using dictionaries and getAttr with a search for other dictionaries, or a function call. For the lulz.
The menu looks like this:
Select program Mode:
1 Administrator Mode
2 User Mode

P.S. All comments are in Russian. If someone will use it, I will change it to English
